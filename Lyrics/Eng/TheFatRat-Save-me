I 
See the light inside your eyes 
You make me feel like 
I'm awake 
I 
Don't know why 
You make me shine 
Like a Star in the sky 
I'm Ok 
I 
Wanna take a breath 
I'm falling in love 
I'm falling in love! 
I 
Wanna hold your hand 
Don't leave me alone 
Don't leave me alone! 

[ĐK:] 
You get me high 
Oh yeah! 
Be by my side 
Baby yeah! 
Only you can save me 
Only you can save me! 

I 
Hold your tight 
You blow my mind 
Like a bottle of wine 
I'm insane 
I 
Come alive 
You drive my wild 
When I kiss you at night 
I'm Ok! 
I 
Wanna take a breath 
I'm falling in love 
I'm falling in love! 
I 
Wanna hold your hand 
Don't leave me alone 
Don't leave me alone! 

[ĐK:] 
You get me high 
Oh yeah ! 
Be by my side 
Baby yeah! 
Only you can save me 
Only you can save me! 

You get me high 
Oh yeah! 
Be by my side 
Baby yeah! 
Only you can save me 
Only you can save me!
