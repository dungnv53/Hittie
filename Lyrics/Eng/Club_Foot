One, take control of me?
You're messing with the enemy
Said its 2, it's another trick
Messin with my mind, I wake up
Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone with the dirty trick
It's taken all these days to find ya
I tell you I want you
I tell you I need you
Friends, take control of me
Stalking cross' the gallery
All these pills got to operate
The color quits and all invade us
There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got is a dirty trick
I'm chasin' down all walls to save ya
I tell you I want you
I'll tell you I need you
I, the blood ain't on my face
Just wanted you near me
I tell you I want you
I'll tell you I need you
The blood ain't on my hands
Just wanted you near me
