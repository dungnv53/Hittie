"40 Day Dream"

I been sleepin for 40 days and
I know Im sleeping cuz this dream’s too amazin
She got gold doorknobs where her eyes used to be
One turn and I learned what it really means to see

[Chorus]
Ah – It’s the magical mystery kind
Ah – must be a lie
Bye bye to the too good to be true kind of love
Oh – I could die
Oh now I can die

I been sleepin for 60- days and
Nobody better pinch me
Bitch I swear I’ll go crazy
She got jumper cable lips
She got sunset on her breath now
I inhaled just a little bit
Now I got no fear of death now

[Chorus]

OhhAhhYeahYeah Yeah Yeah

[Chorus]
