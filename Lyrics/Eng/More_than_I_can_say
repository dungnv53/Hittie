"More Than I Can Say"

Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
I love you more than I can say
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow
Whoa-oh
Love you more than I can say

Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
I miss you ev'ry single day
Why must my life be filled with sorrow
Ooooh, oh
I love you more than I can say

Ah, don't you know I need you so
Oh, tell me please
I gotta know
Do you mean to make me cry
Am I just another guy

Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
I love you more than I can say
Why must my life be filled with sorrow
Whoa-oh
I'll love you twice as much tomorrow

Am I just another guy

Whoa, whoa

Whoa-oh
Love you more than I can say
I love you more than I can say
